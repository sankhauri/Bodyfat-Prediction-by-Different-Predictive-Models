##  Bodyfat-Prediction-by-Different-Predictive-Models
In this project we will fit a Different Regression Models to predict the percentage of body fat.
Body fat, one measure of health, has been accurately estimated by an underwater weighing technique. 
But fitting body fat to the other measurements using multiple regression provides a convenient way 
of estimating body fat for men using only a scale and a measuring tape.We will be using a dataset 
in which the percentage of body fat, age, weight, height, and ten body circumference measurements 
(e.g., abdomen) were recorded for 252 men. The data were generously supplied by Dr. A. Garth Fisher, 
Human Performance Research Center, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 84602,who gave permission 
to freely distribute the data and use them for non-commercial purposes. Reference to the data is made 
in Penrose, et al. [1].
